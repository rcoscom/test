This is a file full of mistakes.
To remember --> CTRL+insert (copy); SHIFT+insert (paste)
This is test 2.
Other notes:
Don't use very large files (1GB max). Large number of (small) files is not very problematic.

Most important commands:
git diff 
git status
git add
git commit

0.1 --> Commit C
0.2 --> Commit E

This is going to be 0.2

Now I can write from github!! woaaah!
